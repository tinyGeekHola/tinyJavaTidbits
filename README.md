# tinyJavaTidbits
 
June 2 Started this repository as I am working through w3schools.com for the purpose of creating my own website for java learning.
I want to create something akin to http://patrickjmt.com but for java. The main idea is a collection of videos with targeted learning
aimed at AP CS but with shorter videos than are typically found on the internet/youtube.
I will use these in my review material for my students and make them available to others learning java
